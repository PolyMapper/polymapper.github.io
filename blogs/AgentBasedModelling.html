                                    <p>Agent Based Models (ABMs) are closely related to Microsimulation models (MSMs) (See previous blog past), in terms of their foundations; Michel et al. (2009) go so far as to say that MSMs provided a theoretical starting point for ABMs. The main focus of this methodology is the behaviour of multiple, heterogeneous and autonomous, individuals, or agents, working collectively to solve a problem which is beyond the knowledge of any particular individual. Both ABMs and MSMs aim to simulate social interactions and individual behaviours, and are founded on global consequences of interactions between individuals, therefore provide a natural way of handling individual behaviours.</p>

                                    <p>While MSMs and ABMs share a conceptual origin and similar aims, they go about achieving these aims in a divergent manner. At a basic level MSMs are typically large synthetic populations contained within databases, with each individual holding potentially many variables or attributes. The behaviours and states of these individual units are dictated by predefined rules applied in isolation.  As a consequence, individuals do not directly interact with each other. ABMs, on the other hand, are built from idea of interacting autonomous individuals, with each single agent having its own set of rules that dictate behaviour which can affect the manner of interaction between agents and the environment. These local interactions can also feedback, bilaterally, which is an important consideration in situations that require possible changes in agents’ behaviour caused by external influences, such as policy that affect the relationships between an agent and the environment, which in turn could feedback and impact on the policy. To this end, Patt & Siebenhuner (2005), discussed the suitability of ABM within the context of assessing how changes in policy can impact on how an individual adapts to climate change.</p> 
  									
									
                                    <p>The autonomous agent concept has roots in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), where there is an attempt to replicate human behaviour. Agents are mobile, and capable of interactions with each other, and the environment in which they are contained. A key feature of agents is their ability to adapt and learn, depending on the situation. Agents are able to adapt and change their relationships between the environment and/or other agents. This is exemplified by Malleson et al. (2010), who used Physical condition, Emotional states, Cognitive capabilities, and Social status (PECS) to model the motives and behaviours of criminals. Agent adaptive learning is seen a step forward in better understanding and representing complex behaviour. In essence, agents can exercise choice, whereas individual units within MSMs cannot. Having said this, integrating realistic human behaviour into ABMs is difficult, primarily due to the short history of ABMs and the scientific study of human behaviour.</p>			

                                    <p>ABMs are particular useful in assessing problems which are inherently spatial and require the modelling of individual decision making, an area where MSMs traditionally suffer. As with MSMs, ABMs tend to revolve around policy and decision making applications, however they differ in that individuals have particular goals or can be constrained by resources. A good example is TRANSIMS, an ABM which is aimed at modelling urban traffic, where individual vehicles are represented within a large urban environment, with time being progressed by the second. This type of model greatly aids those making decisions about transport and urban planning. Malleson et al. (2012) also took advantage of the spatial and behavioural qualities of ABMs to accurately simulate crime. The basic reasoning for the development of this model was that if crime could be replicated and simulated accurately enough, then a greater understanding of the underlying processes and dynamics of crime could be gained, therefore preventative measures could be put in places where they are needed most. Another example of a spatially explicit ABMs is the assessment of crowd congestion at the Notting Hill carnival in London. This model looked at how agents move along paths, interacting with the environment, and their behaviour when part of a larger group.</p>										

                                    <p>Recently some authors have started to utilise ABMs within demography, and as Billari et al (2002) illustrates, they have the potential to aid comprehension of demographic behaviour. Chiefly ABMs focus on the dynamics of behaviour between each agent, something which MSMs are weak at, making it appropriate for modelling demographic processes. Additionally, agents are able to account for behavioural rules provided at the micro and the macro level, therefore can be subject to macro conventions, while following individualised built-in rules.  This capability, along with the ability to model complex non-linear problem make ABMs ideal for dealing with issues that MSMs typically struggle, such as migration or the decision to move.</p>
									
                                    <p>It must be noted that although the broad application of MSMs and ABMs, concerning policy decision making and demographics, overlap in terms of what they are trying to achieve, the geographical scope differs. ABMs are often limited practically by computing power restrictions, by its inherent complexity and the number of agents within the model. Therefore, ABMs primarily focus on cities or regional areas, whereas MSMs are often applied nationally.</p>
