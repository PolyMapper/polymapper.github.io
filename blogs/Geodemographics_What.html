                                    <p>In a new series of blog posts I am going to be discussing something which I spent a lot of time studying while undertaking my masters: geodemographics. Geodemographics are underpinned by the theory that facets of social geography have repeating patterns (Weiss, 2000), with non-contiguous geographical areas potentially having similar social characteristics. Harris et al (2005, p.225) described geodemographics as “the analysis of socio-economic and behavioural data about people, to investigate the geographical patterns that structure and are structured by the forms and functions of settlements”. This description conveys the central theme of geodemographics: clustering of areal units into homogenous groupings that are statistically similar to one another, and distinct from the other groupings (Tsapanos et al., 2015).</p>

                                    <p>Humans have a long history of attempting to bring order to the seemingly infinitely complex social and natural worlds through taxonomically principled area classifications (Singleton & Longley, 2009). These area classifications provide a neat way of summarising a plethora of data and information into an easily digestible classification value (Singleton & Spielman, 2014). Among the first to utilise this technique was Charles Booth in his 1889 Descriptive Map of London Poverty (Harris et al., 2005). In this work, Booth attempted to analyse the spatial distribution of deprivation within London by generating an area classification based on School Board reports, which were available at household level (Harris et al., 2005). Although census data was available Booth determined this to be inadequate and too subjective for his purposes (Harris et al., 2005). Interestingly, this is following a modern trend of using ancillary data sources, although Booth’s use was out of necessity rather than choice. This classification differed from the ones of today in that multiple categories could be applied to a single area (Harris et al., 2005). Booth’s ‘fuzzy’ classification was employed in an attempt to mitigate the assumed areal uniformity of socio-economic factors. This was one of the first attempts to find a way around the ecological fallacy, an issue that would stay with area classifications for the next 120 years.</p> 
									
                                    <p>The work conducted by Booth provided theoretical and methodological underpinnings to the theories of social structure within cities, developed by the Chicago School of Urban Sociology in the 1920s and 1930s (Pfautz, 1967). While Booth aimed at creating a multivariate classification, Park et al. (1925), and the Chicago School, were employing the theory of ‘natural areas’ within cities (Harris et al., 2007). These natural areas were economically, socially, and physically distinct geographical units that allow the cities to be polygonised into discrete neighbourhoods which could be then be compared and analysed (Harris et al., 2007). It must be noted that these neighbourhoods were defined using the administrative boundaries of the time, consequently it has been debated whether thesedo, in fact, reflect natural area neighbourhoods in its truest sense. This issue has been formulated and discussed by Openshaw (1984) and others, in the form of the MAUP, which will be expanded upon further on in this literature review.</p>				

                                    <p>The development of natural areas into social area analysis in the 1950s, through to factorial ecologies in the 1960s was part of a wider evolution in analytical techniques, in what Brown (1991) calls a quantitative resolution, fuelled by the increased available of census data (Brown, 1991). As data availability boomed, new multivariate methods such as factor analysis, allowed for the distillment of large data sources into a something more easily understood (Singleton & Spielman, 2014). This accumulated knowledge and experience gained gave rise to the commercial use of areal unit classification and the coining of the term ‘geodemographics’ (Singleton & Longley, 2009). This was a noted departure from the standard use of areal unit classifications up to this point, which was focused on the dissemination and understanding of the patterns in the spatial distribution of deprivation and poverty (Harris et al., 2005). The first small area classification was developed in the 1970’s, allowing for distinct clusters to be compared to national averages. </p>										

                                    <p>With the turn of the millennium came the increased availability of the census data, free for publication and use (Singleton & Longley, 2009). Whilst already accessible to the academic community, it had a galvanising effect on the commercial sector, giving rise to a host of new companies and classification, such as EuroDirect (now Callcredit Information Group) with CAMEO. However, as areal unit classification use increased in the private sector, there was disillusionment in the academic community (Longley, 2007).  The disengagement is evident through the low number of academic papers referring or utilising geodemographics at this time. A major reason for this was the opaque nature of the private sector. The methodological choices behind the commercial classifications, such as weighing and cluster methods, become inaccessible, in an effect known as ‘black boxing’ (Longley, 2007). Another potential reason is the lack of scientific standards reported by commercial companies, resulting in an inability to ascertain if clusters are naturally occurring or a project of crude dissections (Longely, 2007). This is linked to the lack of uncertainty reported on classifications; in the commercial sphere classifications are purported to be absolute, and do not allow for public discussion of potential misclassification (Longely, 2007), which is an issue for public and academic use. To counter act some of these issues the Output Area Classification (OAC) was developed in 2001 by the ONS, and later updated in 2011, as an open source geodemographic classification (Vickers et al., 2005). </p>
