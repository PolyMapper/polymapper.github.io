                                    <p>Since the 1950s there has been a paradigm shift away from aggregated models towards more individual based models (IMBs), of which two main branches will be discussed here: microsimulation models (MSMs) and agent based models (ABMs). The former which will be discussed here, the latter will be discussed in another blog post.</p>

                                    <p>Microsimulation is a well-established methodology with a strong theoretical background, due to its 50-year history. It is borne from the ideas of Orcutt (1957), who, in an effort to mitigate errors resulting from the use of aggregated data in the simulation of human populations, proposed a model comprised of individual interacting units that act upon inputs and produce outputs. Therefore, one of the primary focuses of microsimulation is to create a micro-level synthetic population, derived from individual or household level surveys, on which probabilistic based rules can be applied, simulating the state and behaviour of an individual unit, and the progression of time. This allows for the empirical appraisal of consequences ensuing from changes in stimuli on individuals within a population, such as evaluating changes in public policy on individual behaviour over time.</p> 
  									
									
                                    <p>Within MSMs individuals are modelled in differing ways depending upon the type of MSM in question. There are three common categories of MSM: static, dynamic, and spatial. Static simulation involves static aging techniques where the changes in population are not modelled explicitly by the MSM, ergo the micro-level populations will remain directly related to a particular point in time. Dynamic models allow more complex methods that update the behaviours and situations of individuals over time by using transition probabilities, such as mortality and fertility at the micro-level, thus permitting characteristic based events to occur.  Consequently, dynamic MSMs are able to more faithfully forecast populations to a point in the future. Spatial MSMs are used to incorporate geography within the modelling process, allowing for the generation of synthetic populations within geographic boundaries. This process involves the disaggregation of small area population data, from sources such as the census, using individual level sample surveys and a number of possible algorithms to determine probabilities of an individual’s characteristics, such as deterministic reweighting, simulated annealing, and conditional probability. </p>			

                                    <p>MSMs have been well utilised within the social sciences, primarily within the fields of demographics and policy recommendations. MSMs have primarily been used to model demographic evolution, which is the starting point for other complex issues, such as age, health, pensions, and transport policies. A prime example of this is found in Smith et al. (2011) who used determinist reweighting within a spatial MSM. The SimHealth model described by Smith et al. (2011) has been used to develop health profiles for those within West Yorkshire, which helped determine the prevalence of diabetes, and described dietary and smoking habits. Related to this is the work by Brown & Harding (2002) who explained the benefits of using MSM in understanding the role of variable population demographics in future health policies. </p>										

                                    <p>The very nature of MSMs means they are highly empirical, therefore are suited to problems of prediction and forecasting, such as policy ‘what if’ scenarios. The use of MSMs ensures that models are strongly grounded within reality and well tested using established statistical methods which is in contrast to ABMs which have a greater challenge in finding appropriate data in enough numbers for calibration and validation. However, Gilbert and Troitzsch, (2005) explained that MSMs are difficult to validate also, and perhaps too data hungry. UrbanSim is an example of a MSM that focuses on urban land use to help aid policy decision making.</p>
