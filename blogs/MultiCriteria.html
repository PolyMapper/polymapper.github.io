                                    <p>There are numerous different land assessment methodologies; two well-known methodologies are the Land Capability Assessment (LCA) and the Multi-Criteria Evaluation (MCE). This post will critically evaluate the latter by assessing the agricultural capacity of an area in Scotland within ArcMap.</p>

                                    <p>MCE is a powerful methodology to follow as it provides a flexible way of combining many factors. Out of the multiple MCE methodologies; this paper focuses on the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). AHP, developed by Saaty (1980), is a mathematical methodology for determining factor weightings based on pre-established pairwise comparisons. This methodology follows three main steps: determining limiting factors; creating factor weights; and applying weights to produce a land assessment map.</p>

										<h2>Getting the factors</h2> 
                                    </div>    
									
                                    <p>Through consultation of the literature, limiting factors were determined as climate, gradient, wetness, aspect, and accessibility. Climate is seen as the fundamental limiting factor (as it can restrain plant growth by dictating energy availability for photosynthesis, and affect water supply to. It is, however, argued that gradient is the most influential limiting factor. It constrains agricultural development through restriction of mechanical operation and heightened soil erosion. Nonetheless, Bibby et al.’s (1991) study was based in Scotland, so climate is considered slightly more influential. Dinh & Duc (2012) noted that natural factors should have equal importance, a view shared by FAO (1976), thus, wetness and aspect are treated as equally limiting. However, climate and gradient were deemed more influential. Wetness can hamper vegetation development by preventing root growth through poor aeration and low soil temperatures. While aspect can affect the amount of solar radiation a particular site receives, with south facing slopes generally having higher daily temperatures. Lastly, Arnot & Grant (1981) explained that accessibility to land is an important factor to consider in land assessment. Due to it being a non-natural factor, it was ranked lowest in terms of influence on land capability.</p>				

                                    <p>Once determined, the factors need to be calculated and mapped. In addition to the already established climate and gradient data, the wetness index was calculated by combing upslope area, slope, and topographical flow accumulation data. The wetness index is defined by Sorensen et al. (2006) as:</p>

									 </div>
									 <!-- Post Coding (SyntaxHighlighter) End -->									

                                    <p>Aspect was calculated from the DEM within ArcMap, and then converted to a linear scale, with 1 being North and 0 South. Subsequently, accessibility was estimated by adding the Euclidean distance from urban areas, and Euclidean distance from a road, together.</p>

										<h2>Getting the weightings</h2> 
                                    </div> 									
									

                                    <p>Initially, a pairwise comparison was conducted by assessing the relative importance of each factor against every other factor using Table 1. These rankings were determined by reading the literature, arguments of which can be seen in Table 1. The pairwise rankings (Table 2) are then used to create standardised weightings, indicating individual factor influence. The AHP can be checked for consistency by using the consistency ratio (CR). It is accepted 0.1 indicates a tolerable level of inconsistency, any more is inadequate. The CR value for this paper was 0.007.</p>

										<h2>Combining the factors</h2> 
                                    </div> 
									
                                    <p>Before the factor maps were combined, urban, sea and loch areas, where excluded, using a mask. For ease of assessment, factor maps were standardised to a scale of 0-1. The individual factors were then multiplied by the weightings, and added together, to give a final score. Eastman (1999) noted that there is no standard threshold MCE capability, consequently the final score was reclassified into 7 categories using the Jenks natural break method, with 1 being the worst score.</p>

                                    <p>The main appeal of MCE methodology is its flexibility; it can incorporate many quantitative and qualitative factors. Also, relative weights denoting influence can be applied to each factor, and be varied depending on local knowledge. In addition, MCE is a transparent, which means it is easy to determine which variables have what weightings, and consequently, what is the most dominant.</p>

                                    <p>There are several negative aspects to MCE; principally subjectivity. The selection of factors and pairwise comparisons are subjective. This limitation becomes more apparent when there is little knowledge of the study area. The lack of knowledge can lead to incorrectly assigned factor weightings. However, both can be, at least slightly, mitigated through use of local and expert opinion, through questionnaires, interviews, and/or forums. This reduces reliance on the opinions of one individual, hence decreasing the issue of subjectivity. Nonetheless, Park et al. (2011) argues that MCE studies are unrepeatable, but no less significant in the results produced.</p>
