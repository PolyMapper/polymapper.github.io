have a web app that takes your location, and checks when you are within 10m of the clue/site.

When you are the clue icon popups up on the map. You press on it and it will open up a quiz. Go through the quiz, and once you get all the correct answers it gives you another clue. These could be riddles.

Create a web version first then an android app. This is so the web app is a backup
